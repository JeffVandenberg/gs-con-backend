# Gaming Convention Web Application

## Introduction
This repository contains the backend design and implementation for a comprehensive gaming convention management web application. The application aims to streamline the organization and management of gaming conventions, including attendee registration, event scheduling, game library management, and vendor coordination.

## Documentation

The following documentation is available in this repository:

- [Database Design](docs\database_design.md): Detailed database schema design with entities, attributes, and relationships.
- [API Design](docs\api_design.md): Comprehensive REST API specification for interacting with the system.
- [Entity-Relationship Diagram](docs\er_diagram.md): Visual representation of the database schema.
- [Technology Stack Recommendations](docs\tech_stack.md): Suggested technologies for implementation.
- [Project Summary](docs\project_summary.md): Overview of the project, features, and implementation approach.

## Project Status
This project is currently in the design phase. The database schema, API endpoints, and technology recommendations have been defined, but implementation has not yet begun.

## Features
