# Technology Stack Recommendations for Gaming Convention Web Application

## Overview
This document outlines recommended technology choices for implementing the gaming convention web application based on the database schema and API design documents. These recommendations aim to provide a modern, scalable, and maintainable solution.

## Database Technology

### Recommendation: PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is recommended as the primary database for the following reasons:

1. **Robust Relational Model**: The gaming convention database has complex relationships between entities that are well-suited to a relational database.
2. **JSON Support**: PostgreSQL offers excellent JSON/JSONB support for flexible data when needed.
3. **UUID Support**: Native UUID type for primary keys as specified in the schema.
4. **Scalability**: Handles large datasets well and supports partitioning for future growth.
5. **Transactional Integrity**: ACID compliance ensures data consistency across related tables.
6. **Advanced Features**: Supports complex queries, full-text search, and other features that may be useful as the application grows.

### Alternative: MySQL/MariaDB
A viable alternative if the team has more experience with these technologies.

## Backend API Framework

### Recommendation: PHP 8.x
PHP 8.x is selected as the backend programming language for the API implementation:

1. **Mature Ecosystem**: Extensive library ecosystem with Composer package manager.
2. **Modern Features**: PHP 8.x includes JIT compilation, union types, attributes, and other performance improvements.
3. **Framework Options**: Laravel, Symfony, or Slim for robust API development.
4. **ORM Options**: Doctrine, Eloquent, or PDO for PostgreSQL integration.
5. **Widespread Hosting**: Easy deployment on various hosting platforms.
6. **Developer Familiarity**: Preferred programming language of the development team.

### PHP Framework Considerations
- **Laravel**: Full-featured framework with built-in authentication, queues, and ORM.
- **Symfony**: Component-based architecture allowing for custom implementations.
- **Slim**: Lightweight framework focused specifically on API development.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Recommendation: JWT with OAuth 2.0
1. **JWT for Tokens**: As specified in the API design, JWT provides a stateless authentication mechanism.
2. **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Implement password grant for direct login and authorization code flow for potential third-party integrations.
3. **Refresh Token Rotation**: Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security.

### Implementation Libraries:
- **PHP**: Firebase JWT, lcobucci/jwt, or php-open-source-saver/jwt-auth for Laravel
- **Session Management**: Redis will be used for session storage and management

## API Documentation

### Recommendation: OpenAPI (Swagger)
1. **Interactive Documentation**: Provides interactive API documentation for developers.
2. **Client Generation**: Can generate client libraries for various platforms.
3. **Validation**: Can validate requests against the schema.

### Implementation Tools:
- **PHP**: Swagger-PHP, zircote/swagger-php, or Laravel OpenAPI packages
- **UI**: Swagger UI for interactive documentation

## Deployment and Infrastructure

### Recommendation: Docker with Kubernetes
1. **Containerization**: Docker containers for consistent environments across development and production.
2. **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing containers, scaling, and high availability.
3. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for continuous integration and deployment.

### Alternative: Serverless Architecture
For smaller deployments or to minimize operational overhead:
- AWS Lambda with API Gateway
- Azure Functions
- Google Cloud Functions

## Frontend Technology

The frontend will be developed using React:

1. **Framework**: React
2. **State Management**: Redux or Context API
3. **API Client**: Axios or fetch with async/await
4. **UI Components**: Material-UI, Ant Design, or Tailwind CSS
5. **Build Tools**: Create React App, Vite, or Next.js

## Development Tools

1. **Version Control**: Git with GitHub or GitLab
2. **Code Quality**:
   - PHP_CodeSniffer and PHP-CS-Fixer for PHP
   - ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript/React
3. **Testing**:
   - PHPUnit or Pest for PHP
   - Jest and React Testing Library for React
4. **Database Migrations**:
   - Laravel Migrations
   - Doctrine Migrations
   - Phinx

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Application Monitoring**: New Relic or Datadog
2. **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog
3. **Error Tracking**: Sentry

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all input on the server side
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. **HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS for all communications
4. **CORS**: Configure proper CORS policies
5. **Security Headers**: Implement security headers (Content-Security-Policy, etc.)
6. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies for vulnerabilities

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up database schema
2. Implement authentication system
3. Create basic user management endpoints

### Phase 2: Event Management
1. Implement event creation and management
2. Develop registration system
3. Add location and category management

### Phase 3: Game Library
1. Build game database
2. Implement library management
3. Develop checkout system

### Phase 4: Additional Features
1. Add vendor management
2. Implement sponsor features
3. Develop reporting capabilities

## Conclusion

The recommended technology stack provides a solid foundation for implementing the gaming convention web application. The choices emphasize modern, well-supported technologies that align with the requirements outlined in the database schema and API design.

The actual implementation may vary based on team expertise, specific requirements, and organizational constraints. This document serves as a starting point for technology decisions and can be adapted as needed.
